# HandGenerator

My bridge club has opted to begin using predealt hands during private team matches on BBO. Two sources I know of for generating LIN files for such use are playbridge.com and the Dealer4 software. It turns out the former is cumbersome and the latter runs on Windows only&mdash;no good! My aim is to quickly generate a number of hands to upload to BBO without using a second machine or switching OS's.

## Getting Started

The only way this (incomplete) software can be used at present is to download the source code and compile and run it yourself.
